Hey, this my nixvim flake. With it you can reproduce my editor anywhere that runs nix :D

If you don't know about Nix and NixOS [check it out](https://nixos.org/)!
[Nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) is a way to declare your
neovim configuration with Nix. Once you use nixvim you
won't ever again fear running an update on your NeoVim plugins.
